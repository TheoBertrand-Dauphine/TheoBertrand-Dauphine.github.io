localization microscopy data"

excerpt: 'In this paper we learn to locate and classify landmark points in the vascular tree from blood vessel images in order to propose a complete tracking of the vascular network shown in the image.

Abstract. Segmentation of tubular structures in vascular imaging is a well studied task, although it is rare that we tryto infuse knowledge of the tree-like structure of the regions to be detected.  Our work focuses on detectingthe important landmarks in the vascular network (via CNN performing both localization and classificationof  the  points  of  interest)  and  representing  vessels  as  the  edges  in  some  minimal  distance  tree  graph.   Weleverage geodesic methods relevant to the detection of vessels and their geometry, making use of the space ofpositions and orientations so that 2D vessels can be accurately represented as trees.  We build our model tocarry tracking on Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) data, proposing to build a good cost functionfor tracking on this type of data. We also test our framework on synthetic and eye fundus data. Results showthat the Orientation Score built from ULM data yields good geodesics for tracking blood vessels but scarcityof well annotated ULM data is an obstacle to the localization of vascular landmarks.
