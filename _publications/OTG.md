excerpt: '

Abstract. We propose an improved strategy for point sources tracking in an image stack through
an off-the-grid fashion, inspired by the Benamou-Brenier regularisation in the literature. We
propose a lifting strategy of the problem in the higher dimensional space of the roto-translation
group. This allows to overcome the theoretical limitation of the off-the-grid method concerning
the tangled trajectories, thus enabling the reconstruction of tangled point sources trajectories
from the numerical standpoint. We introduce accordingly a new regularisation based on the
relaxed Reeds-Shepp metric, an approximation of the sub-Riemannian Reeds-Shepp metric,
further allowing the control on the local curvature of the recovered trajectories. We also derive
some properties of the discretisation and prove a Γ-convergence result, showing the interest for
practical applications of Bézier discretisation rather than the geodesic by parts, said to be optimal
in the litterature. Then, we test our proposed method on a localisation problem example, and we
compare it to the state-of-the-art off-the-grid method, and we eventually implement our method
on an Ultrasound Localisation Microscopy (ULM) in silico problem.
