Abstract. Leveraging geodesic distances and the geometrical informa-
tion they convey is key for many data-oriented applications in imaging.
Geodesic distance computation has been used for long for image segmen-
tation using Image based metrics. We introduce a new method by gen-
erating isotropic Riemannian metrics adapted to a problem using CNN
and give as illustrations an example of application. We then apply this
idea to the segmentation of brain tumours as unit balls for the geodesic
distance computed with the metric potential output by a CNN, thus
imposing geometrical and topological constraints on the output mask.
We show that geodesic distance modules work well in machine learn-
ing frameworks and can be used to achieve state-of-the-art performances
while ensuring geometrical and/or topological properties.
